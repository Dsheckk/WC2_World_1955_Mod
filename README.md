# WC2_World_1955_Mod
Repository of a fantasy World 1955 Mod for World Conqueror 2.

Note: This entire package is not only a map mod, but a game mod as well. 

-Files such as "carddef.xml" and "armydef.xml" have been modified to a point where they will affect the rest of the game's physics, gameplay, and natural stature of balance on other maps.

-If you wish to remove this mod, you must simply copy the original files (I suggest doing so BEFORE installing the mod), and simply paste and overwrite the mod files.
